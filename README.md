# Pacer: Autonomous Rover with Computer Vision

Welcome to the Pacer project repository! Pacer is an autonomous rover equipped with cutting-edge computer vision capabilities, powered by Google's Vision Transformer (ViT) model. This project aims to enhance environmental monitoring and disaster response efforts by leveraging AI-driven technology to detect smoke and fire in real-time.

## Key Features
- ** Navigation:** Pacer utilizes advanced navigation algorithms to traverse various terrains and environments on predefined path.
- **Computer Vision:** The rover is equipped with Google's Vision Transformer (ViT) model, enabling it to detect smoke and fire with high accuracy and efficiency.
- **Automated Email System:** Upon detecting smoke or fire, Pacer automatically sends email alerts to designated recipients, facilitating rapid response and mitigation efforts.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies and libraries specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Configure the email settings and recipient list in the email automation module.
4. uplaod the C++ code into your mcore baord.
5. upload the python scripts onto your rasberryPi.
6. configure your Pi camera.
7. Run the main script and keep the email script contiously running.
